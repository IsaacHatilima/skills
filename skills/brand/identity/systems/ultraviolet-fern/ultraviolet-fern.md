Brand colours: Fuchsia Blue #8654C9 (primary), Enchanted Forest #5F8316 (accent). Charts: Enchanted Forest shades plus Fuchsia Blue. Logo and icon only: Bright Gold #F4D80E (spark), Eigengrau #17161C (ink).

## Brand colours

- Brand 1 · primary: [Fuchsia Blue](https://github.com/IsaacHatilima/brand-colours/blob/main/colors/fuchsia-blue.md) (#8654C9, RGB 134, 84, 201), the primary scale's anchor at step 500. Light UI uses primary-500 (#8654C9); dark UI uses primary-300 (#B89EE7).
- Brand 2 · accent: [Enchanted Forest](https://github.com/IsaacHatilima/brand-colours/blob/main/colors/enchanted-forest.md) (#5F8316, RGB 95, 131, 22), the accent scale's anchor at step 500. Light UI uses accent-600 (#496802); dark UI uses accent-300 (#A0B87F).

Supporting neutrals are plain greys, not brand colours: paper #FAFAFA for light pages, grey #666668 for muted text, and the ink for text and dark pages.

## Logo and icon colours

The two brand colours plus two that exist only for the logo and icon. Bright Gold and Eigengrau never appear as UI colours.

- Spark: [Bright Gold](https://github.com/IsaacHatilima/brand-colours/blob/main/colors/bright-gold.md) (#F4D80E). The signal light: a single dot, stroke or highlight in the mark.
- Ink: [Eigengrau](https://github.com/IsaacHatilima/brand-colours/blob/main/colors/eigengrau.md) (#17161C). Wordmark and one-colour versions.

## Pairing rationale

Ultraviolet and fern green sit far apart on the wheel, so the accent pops against violet controls. Bright gold adds a third signal in the mark.

## Tokens

Light is the default; dark follows the system setting or `data-theme="dark"`. Use the semantic tokens in UI code, never raw scale steps.

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| bg | #FAFAFA | #17161C | Page background: a plain off-white in light, the Eigengrau ink in dark. Text on it uses `text` (17.2:1) and `text-muted` (5.5:1 light, 7.6:1 dark). |
| surface | #FFFFFF | #222127 | Cards, panels, table bodies and inputs, placed on `bg`. Text on it uses `text` and `text-muted`. |
| surface-raised | #FFFFFF | #2C2B32 | Menus, popovers, dialogs and toasts. Pair with `shadow-pop`; in dark it is one step lighter than `surface`. |
| surface-sunken | #F2F2F4 | #1C1B21 | Wells, table headers, code blocks and segmented-control tracks. Text on it uses `text` and `text-muted`. |
| border | #E3E3E5 | #37363C | Decorative dividers and card outlines. Never the only edge of a control; use `border-strong` for that. |
| border-strong | #858587 | #76747C | Edges of inputs, checkboxes, secondary buttons and chips. At least 3:1 on `bg` and `surface` in both themes (3.5:1 light, 3.5:1 dark on surface). |
| text | #17161C | #FAFAFA | Primary text and icons on every surface. Eigengrau in light; the paper off-white in dark. |
| text-muted | #666668 | #A8A8AA | Secondary text, captions, helper text and placeholders on `bg`, `surface` and `surface-sunken`. |
| primary | #8654C9 | #B89EE7 | Fill of primary buttons, selected tabs, toggles, progress bars and active nav marks: Fuchsia Blue (primary-500 light, primary-300 dark). Label text on it uses `on-primary`. |
| primary-hover | #6B3FA4 | #D2C3EF | Hover and pressed fill of `primary`. |
| primary-soft | #F6F3FC | #3C265B | Tinted backgrounds: selected rows, hover on secondary buttons, info banners. Text on it uses `text` or `link`. |
| on-primary | #FFFFFF | #17161C | Text and icons on `primary` and `primary-hover` (5.1:1 light, 7.8:1 dark). Dark mode uses ink, not white. |
| link | #6B3FA4 | #D2C3EF | Inline links and text-style buttons on `bg`, `surface` and `primary-soft`. Always underlined in running text. |
| link-hover | #53347F | #E8E2F7 | Hover state of `link`. |
| accent | #496802 | #A0B87F | The single secondary hue, Enchanted Forest: highlights, new-feature badges, chart emphasis, one accent button per view. Label text on it uses `on-accent`. |
| accent-soft | #F3F6F0 | #1D270B | Tinted background for accent badges and callouts. Text on it uses `accent`. |
| on-accent | #FFFFFF | #17161C | Text and icons on `accent` (6.4:1 light, 8.3:1 dark). |
| focus | #496802 | #A0B87F | Keyboard focus ring: 2px solid with a 2px gap in `bg`. 6.2:1 on `bg` in light, 8.3:1 in dark. It uses the accent so it never blends into Fuchsia Blue controls. |
| selection | #E8E2F7 | #3C265B | Text selection background. Text keeps `text`. |
| disabled-bg | #F2F2F4 | #2C2B32 | Fill of disabled buttons and inputs. |
| disabled-text | #858587 | #666668 | Text and icons on `disabled-bg`. Exempt from contrast rules, so never put required information here. |
| success | #13794A | #1BA766 | Success text, icons and fills on `bg`, `surface` and `success-soft` (5.4:1 light, 5.1:1 dark on `surface`). Always paired with a check icon and a word. |
| success-soft | #E4F3EB | #0F2A1E | Background of success banners and badges. Text on it uses `success`. |
| on-success | #FFFFFF | #17161C | Text on solid `success` fills. |
| warning | #915608 | #F4A134 | Warning text, icons and fills (5.9:1 light, 7.6:1 dark on `surface`). Always paired with a triangle icon and a word. |
| warning-soft | #FBEFD9 | #2B1F0A | Background of warning banners and badges. Text on it uses `warning`. |
| on-warning | #FFFFFF | #17161C | Text on solid `warning` fills. |
| danger | #B8331E | #E57361 | Errors and destructive actions: text, icons, fills (5.9:1 light, 5.3:1 dark on `surface`). Always paired with an icon and a word. |
| danger-soft | #FBE9E5 | #2E1612 | Background of error banners and field errors. Text on it uses `danger`. |
| on-danger | #FFFFFF | #17161C | Text on solid `danger` fills. |
| info | #6B3FA4 | #D2C3EF | Informational text and icons. Deliberately the brand hue, so there is no separate blue. |
| info-soft | #F6F3FC | #3C265B | Background of info banners. Text on it uses `info`. |
| chart-1 | #496802 | #A0B87F | Chart series 1, the anchor shade of Enchanted Forest. Use alone for single-series charts. At least 3:1 on `surface` in both themes. Add a direct label or marker to every series. |
| chart-2 | #2A3B0E | #E2E9D9 | Chart series 2, a darker Enchanted Forest in light and a lighter Enchanted Forest in dark. |
| chart-3 | #7DA045 | #5F8316 | Chart series 3, a lighter Enchanted Forest in light and a deeper Enchanted Forest in dark. |
| chart-4 | #3A510D | #C3D3B0 | Chart series 4, a mid shade of Enchanted Forest. |
| chart-5 | #5F8316 | #7DA045 | Chart series 5, the remaining Enchanted Forest shade that still holds 3:1. |
| chart-alt | #8654C9 | #B89EE7 | The one contrasting chart series: Fuchsia Blue, the primary brand colour. Chart colours are only Enchanted Forest shades and Fuchsia Blue, never status or logo colours. |
| chart-grid | #E3E3E5 | #37363C | Gridlines and axis rules inside charts. Axis labels use `text-muted`. |
| ink | #17161C | #17161C | Raw near-black, Eigengrau: the light theme's text and the dark theme's page background. Use the semantic tokens in UI. |
| logo-spark | #F4D80E | #F4D80E | Logo and icon only: Bright Gold, the highlight or signal dot. Never a UI colour. |
| logo-ink | #17161C | #17161C | Logo and icon only: wordmark and one-colour versions, Eigengrau. |

## Scales

Each brand scale is generated from its library anchor. The anchor keeps its exact value at the step nearest its lightness: Fuchsia Blue at primary-500, Enchanted Forest at accent-500. Identical in both themes.

| Step | Primary (Fuchsia Blue) | Primary roles | Accent (Enchanted Forest) | Accent roles | Neutral |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | #F6F3FC | light: primary-soft | #F3F6F0 | light: accent-soft | #F9F9FB |
| 100 | #E8E2F7 | light: selection; dark: link-hover | #E2E9D9 | dark: chart-2 | #F2F2F4 |
| 200 | #D2C3EF | dark: primary-hover, link | #C3D3B0 | dark: chart-4 | #E3E3E5 |
| 300 | #B89EE7 | dark: primary | #A0B87F | dark: accent, chart-1 | #CCCCCE |
| 400 | #A276E3 |  | #7DA045 | light: chart-3; dark: chart-5 | #A8A8AA |
| 500 | #8654C9 | brand anchor; light: primary | #5F8316 | brand anchor; light: chart-5; dark: chart-3 | #858587 |
| 600 | #6B3FA4 | light: primary-hover, link | #496802 | light: accent, chart-1 | #666668 |
| 700 | #53347F | light: link-hover | #3A510D | light: chart-4 | #474749 |
| 800 | #3C265B | dark: primary-soft, selection | #2A3B0E | light: chart-2 | #303032 |
| 900 | #281B3C |  | #1D270B | dark: accent-soft | #1C1C1D |
| 950 | #171023 |  | #111708 |  | #121213 |

## Accessible pairings

AA needs 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text, controls and chart marks.

- Text on page (light): `text` #17161C on `bg` #FAFAFA: **17.2:1**, AAA.
- Muted on page (light): `text-muted` #666668 on `bg` #FAFAFA: **5.5:1**, AA.
- Primary button (light): `on-primary` #FFFFFF on `primary` #8654C9: **5.1:1**, AA.
- Accent button (light): `on-accent` #FFFFFF on `accent` #496802: **6.4:1**, AA.
- Link on page (light): `link` #6B3FA4 on `bg` #FAFAFA: **7.0:1**, AAA.
- Danger on soft (light): `danger` #B8331E on `danger-soft` #FBE9E5: **5.1:1**, AA.
- Dark primary button (dark): `on-primary` #17161C on `primary` #B89EE7: **7.8:1**, AAA.
- Dark muted on surface (dark): `text-muted` #A8A8AA on `surface` #222127: **6.7:1**, AA.
- Dark accent on page (dark): `accent` #A0B87F on `bg` #17161C: **8.3:1**, AAA.
- Dark success on surface (dark): `success` #1BA766 on `surface` #222127: **5.1:1**, AA.
- Dark danger on surface (dark): `danger` #E57361 on `surface` #222127: **5.3:1**, AA.
- Dark warning on surface (dark): `warning` #F4A134 on `surface` #222127: **7.6:1**, AAA.

## Rules

- Use roles in UI code, never raw scale steps.
- Brand colours are Fuchsia Blue and Enchanted Forest only. Bright Gold and Eigengrau are for the logo and icon, never for charts or UI.
- Charts use five shades of Enchanted Forest, plus Fuchsia Blue as the one contrasting series. At least 3:1 on the card. Add a label or marker to every series.
- One primary button per view, and one accent button at most.
- Never signal status by colour alone: icon and word every time.
- Control borders use `border-strong`; decorative ones use `border`.
- In dark mode the primary lightens to primary-300, links to primary-200, and button labels turn ink.
- Enchanted Forest itself sits at accent-500; light-mode UI uses accent-600 so labels and text pass 4.5:1. Use the exact Enchanted Forest in the logo and large graphics.

## Verification notes

- Anchors are the four library colours linked above. Every other value is generated: the 50–950 scales follow Harbour Signal's lightness curve and per-step chroma in OKLCH, the greys are plain neutrals tinted only by the ink's hue, and every value is gamut-mapped to sRGB. Refer to generated values by token, not by a library colour name.
- Contrast audit: 92 documented pairings across both themes, all passing (4.5:1 for text; 3:1 for control borders, focus rings, primary fills and chart series). WCAG 2.x relative luminance; pass/fail uses unrounded ratios.
- Hover, pressed and disabled states are defined, but components still need their own checks in context.
- Character and suggested uses are design judgments, not user-research findings.
